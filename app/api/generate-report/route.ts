Create a professional startup report with the following details:

REPORT DETAILS:
- Report Title: ${title} (THIS IS ONLY A REPORT TITLE/LABEL - DO NOT USE THIS AS THE COMPANY NAME)
- Reporting Period: ${dateRange}
- Target Audience: ${audience}
- Sections to include: ${enabledSections.join(", ")}
${additionalContext}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The title "${title}" is ONLY the report title/label - it is NOT the startup name
2. Create content about a generic startup/company - do NOT reference "${title}" as the company name
3. Use terms like "our startup", "the company", "our organization" instead of using the report title
4. Generate realistic startup content that stands on its own, independent of the report title
5. NEVER refer to the person writing this report as "user" - always use "founder", "founders", or "co-founders"

6. FOUNDER'S NOTES ANALYSIS - FOLLOW THIS DECISION TREE:

   STEP 1: Analyze the founder's notes content
   
   IF notes contain instructions for EXISTING sections:
   - Examples: "add pets to startup description", "mention AI in overview", "include security in risks"
   - Action: Apply these instructions to the relevant sections
   - Result: DO NOT include "additionalNotes" field in JSON response
   
   IF notes contain requests for NEW sections OR standalone information:
   - Examples: "add team culture section", "create partnerships overview", "we have a pet-friendly office", "our company values include sustainability"
   - Action: Create professional content for "additionalNotes" field
   - Result: MUST include "additionalNotes" field in JSON response
   
   STEP 2: Apply the decision
   - Modify existing sections: NO additionalNotes field
   - New sections/info: YES additionalNotes field with professional content

Generate content for each enabled section. Make the content professional, realistic, and appropriate for the target audience.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with ONLY valid JSON. Include ONLY the fields for enabled sections: ${enabledSections.join(", ")}

Base JSON structure (only include enabled sections):
{${enabledSections.includes("startupDescription") ? '\n  "startupDescription": "Professional description...",' : ""}${enabledSections.includes("progressOverview") ? '\n  "progressOverview": "Summary of progress...",' : ""}${enabledSections.includes("tractionMilestones") ? '\n  "tractionMilestones": [\n    "Milestone 1",\n    "Milestone 2"\n  ],' : ""}${enabledSections.includes("risksBottlenecks") ? '\n  "risksBottlenecks": "Analysis of risks...",' : ""}${enabledSections.includes("productStrategy") ? '\n  "productStrategy": "Product strategy...",' : ""}${enabledSections.includes("forecastPriorities") ? '\n  "forecastPriorities": "Forward-looking priorities..."' : ""}}

IMPORTANT: If founder's notes request NEW sections or contain standalone info, ADD this field:
"additionalNotes": "Professional content based on founder's notes"
